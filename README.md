# Video Compression

In the information age today, where petabytes of content is generated and consumed every hour, the ability to compress data fast and reliably is important. Not only does compression make data cheaper for server hosting, it makes content accessible to population/regions with lowbandwidth. Here, alinged with hand-crafted algorithms such as JPEG, HEVC, we introduce machine learning-based compression methods which are showed to achieve better performance in some aspects than conventional codecs.
